# Project Specification

Can a script be written that will pull this data and format it?

- Register for the Bootle game on beatthestreet.me, use a local postcode for sign up.
  - Do not sign up for a team or attempt to connect a card
  - Sign up is to have access to the daily leaderboards to leaderboard data.
  - Intention is to examine how many Players are active by day so that a picture of overall performance or efficacy of the programme can be established. It's suspected that the organisers are manipulating data to mislead public health funders as to the success of the intervention.
- Scrape leaderboard data every day at 12pm for duration of the game (believe this will be 4 or 6 weeks)
- Compile daily leaderboard data into a set.
- Data table to include:
  - Total number of Players registered
  - Player IDs
  - Points scored day-by-day
  - Points scored cumulative
  - Identify those who signed up by email but did not participate in the game
  - Distance travelled (Each 10 points scored roughly equates to 500m travelled)

# Data-Scrape

## Purpose
This version of the code works correctly by scraping data from an online leaderboard:
- records all the user's data and assigns them a PlayerID
- calculates the number of players on the leaderboard
- records results on a day-by-day basis 
- calculates the total of all of the results
- calculates the distance using the results (10 points = 500 metres)
- checks which of the players are participating in the leaderboard

## Issues
Can only scrape data from tables. Currently Working on scraping data from nested tables.
